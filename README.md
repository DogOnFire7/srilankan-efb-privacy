# Privacy Policy — SriLankan Virtual EFB

**Last updated:** June 2026

## Overview

The SriLankan Virtual Electronic Flight Bag ("the EFB", "we", "our") is a flight-simulation companion application built for pilots of the SriLankan Virtual virtual airline. This policy explains what data the EFB accesses through the vAMSYS Pilot API, how that data is used, and how it is protected. The EFB is a non-commercial application used within the context of online flight simulation on the VATSIM network.

## What data we access

When you authorise the EFB to connect to your vAMSYS account, the EFB may access the following data through the vAMSYS Pilot API, strictly limited to the scopes you approve during authorisation:

- **Profile and identity** — your pilot ID, name, rank, and home hub, used to identify you within the EFB.
- **Bookings and dispatch** — your active flight booking and its associated route, aircraft, departure, and arrival information, used to link the EFB to your current flight and to retrieve the matching flight plan.
- **NOTAMs** — airline notices relevant to your flight, displayed within the EFB.

The EFB only requests the minimum scopes required for these features to function.

## How we use your data

Your data is used solely to provide the EFB's features:

- To identify you when you log in.
- To automatically link the EFB to your current flight so that flight plan, checklist, notice, and document information can be displayed.
- To show you operational information relevant to your specific flight.

We do **not** use your data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to operating the EFB.

## How your data is stored

- Flight-related data retrieved from vAMSYS is stored only as long as needed to display it within the EFB during your session and for the duration of your linked flight.
- Authentication is handled using the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE. The EFB does not receive, see, or store your vAMSYS password at any point.
- Access tokens issued by vAMSYS are stored securely and are used only to make authorised API requests on your behalf.

## What we do not do

- We do not share your data with any third party.
- We do not sell your data.
- We do not access any vAMSYS data outside the scopes you explicitly authorise.

## Revoking access

You may revoke the EFB's access to your vAMSYS account at any time through your vAMSYS account settings. Once revoked, the EFB can no longer access your data.

## Third-party services

The EFB integrates with the following third-party services to provide its features:

- **vAMSYS** — for pilot identity and flight booking data.
- **SimBrief** — for operational flight plan (OFP) data, retrieved using your SimBrief username.
- **Navigraph** — navigation charts are accessed via deep links to your own Navigraph subscription; the EFB does not store or redistribute chart data.

Each of these services has its own privacy policy governing the data they hold.

## Contact

For any questions about this privacy policy or how the EFB handles your data, please contact the SriLankan Virtual staff team through the virtual airline's official channels.
